# Data Wrangling and Data Visualization Assignment by Marc Wilson Flores from 2ECE-C
## Problems 
Two problems were presented in this assignment and a .csv file. In the first part, I was tasked to upload the .csv file and use the list in the file to create the following data frames based on the format provided:

a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as
Instrumentation and hometown Luzon

b. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is
constant as Mindanao and gender Female

After that, the next problem tasked me to create a visualization that shows how the different features contribute to the average grades.

## Background
I was not familiar with how to achieve the desired output, so I played with the code a little while consulting my notes until I was finally able to get the desired outcome

For the next problem, I was unfamiliar with which graph to visualize the data. Still, I searched the internet, consulted my notes, and finally decided on bar graphs.

## Outputs
Here are the outputs I achieved for each problem:
